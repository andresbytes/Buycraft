# Buycraft

This plugin is a minimalist implementation of the Tebex API for a PocketMine-MP server. I decided to create it because, at the time, the official Buycraft implementation for PocketMine was not working properly, and I thought it would take me less time to create a new one with the minimum feature set for a network of Minecraft servers than it would take me to fork the official port and adapt it to my needs.
